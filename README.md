# Lightweight ML Models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)

Developed lightweight machine learning models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) by leveraging handcrafted audio characteristics and emotion-based voice analysis. The project utilizes Python, audio-focused libraries, Django for the web interface, and verified code in Jupyter Labs.

## Features

- Speech Emotion Recognition using Machine Learning
- Utilizes Handcrafted Audio Characteristics
- Emotion-Based Voice Analysis
- Python-Based Implementation
- Web Interface powered by Django
- Verified Code in Jupyter Labs
- Published Article on the Topic in Springer

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
- Audio Processing Libraries (e.g., librosa)
- Django (Web Interface)
